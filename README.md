The API code for clusterapp

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/clusterapp/api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/clusterapp/api)

# Endpoints

## Authentication with Reddit

####Â `/auth/reddit?redirect=SITE_TO_REDIRECT_TO`
Takes a user to Reddit to authenticate and then redirects to `redirect`.

The redirect will be passed a query string: `?data=USER_RAW_JSON&token=USER_TOKEN`. `USER_RAW_JSON` will be a stringified JSON object containing all the user's information. You should be able to give this to `JSON.parse` to get an object. `USER_TOKEN` is the token you'll need to pass back to the API for any further API requests.
